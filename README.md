# Kanban Project

Kanban Project is a SwiftUI application that allows you to manage your GitHub repositories through a Kanban board. You can add repositories to your local list and view their issues, organizing them into different states (Backlog, Next, Doing, Done) using an intuitive interface.

## Features

- **View Repositories**: Connect your GitHub account and view your list of repositories.
- **Local Persistence**: Save your local configuration so you can access your repositories and their state at any time.
- **Issue Management**: Retrieve the list of issues from your GitHub repositories and organize them on a Kanban board.
- **Move Issues**: Move issues between different columns (Backlog, Next, Doing, Done) using navigation arrows.
