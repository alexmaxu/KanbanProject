# Kanban Project

Kanban Project is a SwiftUI application that allows you to manage your GitHub repositories through a Kanban board. You can add repositories to your local list and view their issues, organizing them into different states (Backlog, Next, Doing, Done) using an intuitive interface. 

To have a repository with issues to test the app you can use my repository named: "kanban"
